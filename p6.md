## Summarize of the Problem
Find the element in a sorted array `A` with distinct integers which `A[i] = i` in *O(log(n))*

----

### Solution


1. Given an array `A`, look at the element in the middle of the array `A[i]` with index `i`.
2. If `A[i] == i`, print `i` and exit.
3. If `A[i] > i`, start 1 with the left part of the array; else start 1 with the right part until no more elements in array, then the answer does not exist.

## Proof

----

### Correctness

Given that `A` is an sorted array with distinct integers, `A` is a strictly increasing array of all integers. Thus if the middle of the array is already bigger than the index, then the right part will definitely bigger than the index, so what matters is the left part of the array and vice versa. Moreover, a subarray of a strictly increasing array is also a strictly increasing array, thus we can break this problem into multiple subproblems until we find the index we want.

### Time Complexity

In each iteration, we divide the array into two part from the middle until we find the answer or the length of the array equals zero. In the worst case, we have to divide the array *log(n)* times, and each iterations takes *O(1)* time to check, thus the time complexity is *O(log(n))*
